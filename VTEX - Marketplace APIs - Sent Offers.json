The granular details of actions and micro-steps that happen within an interaction's are called [logs](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/marketplace-apis-offer-management#post-/api/sent-offers/feeds/-feedId-/skus/-skuId-/interactions/-interactionId-/logs). \n\nThis endpoint retrieves information about interactions and all logs within it. It allows filtering interactions by using the following query params: `channel`, `brand`, `category`, `scope`, `result`, `fromDate`, `toDate`. This endpoint also counts with the following pagination query params: `sort`, `from`, `to`.",
