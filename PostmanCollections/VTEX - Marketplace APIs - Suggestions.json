If it doesn't, then this is the next call in the SKU integration flow.\n\nIn the Send Suggestion request, the seller must send information about the SKU, such as the product and SKU name, the seller ID, and the image URL. All parameters are explained below.\r\n\r\n## Permissions\r\n\r\nAny user or [application key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-application-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to be able to successfully run this request.
