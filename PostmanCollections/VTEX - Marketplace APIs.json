The invitation's link in the email is unique per user, and available for only seven days for the seller to click and begin activating their store. \n\nThe email template is completely customizable. All email templates that VTEX sends to seller leads can be found and edited in the marketplace's VTEX Admin, on the Message Center section.\r\n\r\n## Permissions\r\n\r\nAny user or [API key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-api-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to be able to successfully run this request. Otherwise they will receive a status code `403` error. These are the applicable resources for this endpoint:\r\n\r\n| **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** |\r\n| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |\r\n| Seller Register | Seller Administration | **Save Seller** |\r\n\r\nYou can [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) with that resource or use one of the following [predefined roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy):\r\n\r\n| **Role** | **Resource** | \r\n| --------------- | ----------------- | \r\n| Create new sellers and edit data from all sellers linked to Marketplace account from the sellers management page. | Save Seller |\r\n\r\n>❗ Assigning a [predefined role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy) to users or application keys usually grants permission to multiple [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3). If some of these permissions are not necessary, consider creating a custom role instead.

It is not necessary to send a request body.\r\n\r\n## Permissions\r\n\r\nAny user or [API key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-api-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to be able to successfully run this request. Otherwise they will receive a status code `403` error. These are the applicable resources for this endpoint:\r\n\r\n| **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** | **Role** |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| Seller Register | Seller adminstration | View Seller | View all sellers linked to the Marketplace account described on the sellers management page, including recovering seller data, either from the sellers listing, or a specific seller. |\r\n| Seller Register | Seller administration | Save Seller | Create new sellers and edit data from all sellers linked to Marketplace account from the sellers management page. |\r\n\r\nYou can [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) with this feature or use one of the predefined roles from the list above.\r\n\r\n >❗ Assigning a [predefined role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) to users or application keys usually grants permission to multiple [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3). If some of these permissions are not necessary, consider creating a custom role instead.
